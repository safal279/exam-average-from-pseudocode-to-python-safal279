# Assignment: Calculate Average of Three Scores

This assignment asks you to write a Python program that collects three exam scores from the user, uses a function you create to compute the average, and then prints each score and the final average on separate lines.

Before writing any code, add your pseudocode at the top of your file as a multi-line comment. After that, write your Python code with a brief comment above each line.

Your output should follow the same general format as the example below:

Enter first score: ...

Enter second score: ...

Enter third score: ...

First score: ...

Second score: ...

Third score: ...

The average score is: ...

Open **main.py** to get started. It contains the instructions for how to organize your work.
